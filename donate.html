<h1>Donations</h1>
<h1>Why you should donate</h1>
<p>There are several reasons to donate, I want to create Merch for the channel, and it would be amazing to be able to afford better filming equipment, or editing software. I need donations to do these because at the time of writing the channel is not popular enough for monetization.</p> 
<h1>How to donate</h1>
<p>Currently I have not found a method for accepting donations, but I am working on setting up a way for you to donate, the current donation method is TBD</p>
